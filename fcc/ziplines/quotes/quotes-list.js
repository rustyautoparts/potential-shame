Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures&#x2026 Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. [&#x2026] The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.",

The course of the computation may be conditional upon results obtained during the computation, but all the alternatives must be foreseen in advance. &#x2026 The requirement for preformulation or predetermination is sometimes no great disadvantage. It is often said that programming for a computing machine forces one to think clearly, that it disciplines the thought process.
