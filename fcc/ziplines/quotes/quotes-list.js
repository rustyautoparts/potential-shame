Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures&#x2026 Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. [&#x2026] The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.",
